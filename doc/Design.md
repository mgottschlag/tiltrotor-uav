### Suitable Parts

- Altimeter: MS5611
- Gyro/accelerometer: MPU6050
- Servos: SG90 (weight 9g)?

## Various Additional Resources

- The PX4 autopilot supports various VTOL configurations: https://docs.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/frames_vtol/
- Two MS5611 sensors can be combined to create an airspeed sensor: http://blueflyvario.blogspot.com/2013/06/air-speed-from-two-ms5611.html

  There are airspeed sensors available that build on the same chip, but just provide a better enclosure with proper hose connections, at much higher prices (e.g., MS4525DO).
